                    The Idea
                </h1>
                <p class="lead">

                    As newcomers to the GNU Social !fediverse some of us had some trouble finding and then choosing a node to start out on.
                    As admin-newcomers many of us had some trouble finding the right how-to or tweak.
                    So here's the short story of the site and its purpose; after reading it you can decide if it's worth sharing and/or contributing.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times</i>...
                    As with any federated network it might get confusing at the beginning,
                    there are pieces of information in different websites, (this site itself is just another drop of water),
                    different people in different parts of the federation cheering for their nodes (which is ok BTW)
                    and against others (which is not ok BTW, IMHO),
                    but no neutral place where newcomers can find <i>all</i> the information
                    new users and possible node admins require.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe that place existed, but I couldn't find it. So I created <a href="http://www.fediverse.org">Fediverse.org</a>,                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What for?</strong> you may ask dear visitor, and you would be right. Many times while coding the first draft I asked myself the same question.
                    <br />
                    So this is the idea:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>New users</strong> (who know the site) must be able to easily find a clear idea of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>What Gnu Social is</li>
                        <li>How the latest version of GNU Social works</li>
                        <li>Why it is different to proprietary microblogging platforms</li>
                        <li>Why its better, despite look&feels and technical problems</li>
                        <li>And most importantly, which public nodes are up and open to sign ups</li>
                    </ol>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Node admins </strong> should be able to find all necessary information to get a node up and running,
                    plus which configuration tweaks are recommended depending on the use case they foresee for their node, and their servers caps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>New Users & Node admins </strong> should be able to trust the information on the basis that fediverse.org
                    won't profit from its traffic, and will not accept sponsorship from any particular node for money.
                    <br />
                    Nodes will be ordered using technical criteria, trying to satisfy the purpose of offering newcomers the best possible options
                    to adopt GNU Social. In fact the site does not have and will not have any advertising of any kind. See <a href="#funding">Funding</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the code is available at <a href="<?php echo FEDIVERSE_GITHUB;  ?>">Github</a> for contributions, suggestions and forking.

                    Funding
                </h1>
                <p class="lead">
                   As being neutral is the core principle of the site and the one that can add some value to its purpose,
                   fediverse.org is a nonprofit site, and plans to fund its maintenance costs with the help of the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I expect to fund the effort, time and costs of maintaining it via users donations, if they please,
                   and if they don't I will maintain it for as long as I can.
                </p>
                <p>                   
                   Additionally, when such community fundings exceed what's necessary for the site's maintenance,
                   the remainings will be donated to the <a href="http://fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a>,
                   as a way to thank them for the job done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Donation information will always be public, in a future <a href="/news/">News</a> section.
                </p>
